    ## [Description](#table-of-contents)
  
    Team manager is a tool I have created using node.js that users can use to manage their work staff through the mySQL database. 
    After creating a database, link it to your index.js with your SQL databases user/pass/port. 
    Following the provided structure, create tables like so.

    Once you have created these tables, any answer you provide to the prompted question will transfer to your database.
